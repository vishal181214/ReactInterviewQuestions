        <h3>What is the Difference between react and react native? Which one is library or framework?</h3>
            <p>React is a JavaScript library of reusable components designed to create skeletons of the 
                apps, whereas React Native is a javascript<br> framework designed to build native mobile apps
                 with reusable components.</p>

        <h3>What is the package name you are using for routing?</h3>

            <pre>

        <h3>What is lazy loading in react?</h3>
            <p>Lazy loading is a technique for waiting to load certain parts of a webpage
               until they are needed. Instead of loading everything all at once, known as<br>
               "eager" loading, the browser does not request certain resources until the 
               user interacts in such a way that the resources are needed.</p>

        <h3>Difference b/w Stateful and stateless Component?</h3>
            <p>The literal difference is that Stateful component has state, and stateless doesnâ€™t. 
                That means the stateful components <br> are keeping track of changing data, while
                stateless components print out what is given to them via props, or they always
                render the same thing.</p>
            <p>Stateful component is also known as Stateful/Container/Smart component</p>
            <p>Stateless component is also known as Stateless/Presentational/Dumb component:</p>

        <h3>How do you switch one component to another, Conditional Rendering?</h3>
            <pre>
                const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;
                if (isLoggedIn) {
                    return <span><</span>UserGreeting /<span>></span>;
                }
