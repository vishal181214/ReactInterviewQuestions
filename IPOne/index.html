            <h3>What is Virtual DOM?</h3>
            <p>The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is an in-memory representation of Real
                DOM. The representation of a UI is kept in memory <br>and synced
                with the "real" DOM. It's a step that happens between the render
                function being called and the displaying of elements on the
                screen.<br> This entire process is called reconciliation.</p>
            <p>The Virtual DOM works in three simple steps.</p>
            <p>1. Whenever any underlying data changes, the entire UI is
                re-rendered in Virtual DOM representation.</p>
            <p>2. Then the difference between the previous DOM representation
                and the new one is calculated.</p>
            <p>3. Once the calculations are done, the real DOM will be updated
                with only the things that have actually changed.</p>


            <h3>What is SPA?</h3>
            <p>An SPA (Single-page application) is a web app implementation that
                loads only a single web document, and then updates<br> the body
                content of that single document via JavaScript APIs such as
                XMLHttpRequest and Fetch when different content is to be shown.</p>
            <h3>What is difference between class and functional component?</h3>
            <p>A functional component is just a plain JavaScript pure function
                that accepts props as an argument and returns a React
                element(JSX).</p>
            <p>A class component requires you to extend from React. Component
                and create a render function which returns a React element.</p>
            <p>There is no render method used in functional components.</p>
            <p>It must have the render() method returning JSX (which is
                syntactically similar to HTML)</p>
            <p>React lifecycle methods (for example, componentDidMount) cannot
                be used in functional components.</p>
            <p>React lifecycle methods can be used inside class components (for
                example, componentDidMount).</p>
            <p>Hooks can be easily used in functional components to make them
                Stateful.</p>
            <p>It requires different syntax inside a class component to
                implement hooks.</p>

            <h3>What do you mean by state and its use in react?</h3>
            <p> The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain
                data or information about the component. A component's<br>state
                can change over time; whenever it changes, the component
                re-renders.</p>

            <h3>What is JSX and why do we use it instead of js?</h3>
            <p>JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them
                in the DOM without any createElement() and/or <br>appendChild()
                methods.</p>
            <p>JSX is a XML-like syntax extension to ECMAScript (the acronym
                stands for JavaScript XML). Basically it just provides<br>
                syntactic sugar for the React.createElement() function, giving
                us expressiveness of JavaScript along with HTML like template
                syntax.</p>
            <p>JSX is an addition to the JavaScript syntax which is a mixture of
                both HTML and JavaScript. Both JS and JSX are <br>interchangeable
                but JSX makes the code easier to understand for users.</p>

            <h3>What is package.json?</h3>
            <p>The package. json file is the heart of any Node project. It
                records important metadata about a project which is required<br>
                before publishing to NPM, and also defines functional attributes
                of a project that npm uses to install dependencies, run scripts,
                and identify the entry point to our package.</p>
